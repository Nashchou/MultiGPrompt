# MultiGPrompt

## Description

The repository is organised as follows:

- **data/**: contains data we use.
- **modelset/**: contains pre-trained model we use
- **MutilGPrompt_CoraCiteseer_node/**: implements pre-training and downstream tasks for Cora and Citeseer.
- **MutilGPrompt_TU_node/**: implements pre-training and downstream task for ENZYMES and PROTEINS. 
- **MutilGPrompt_TU_graph/**: implements pre-training for BZR and COX2, downstream task for BZR,COX2,ENZYMES,PROTEINS.

## Package Dependencies

- cuda 11.3
- cu113
- pyG 2.0.0

## Running experiments

Due to the limitation of file size, we upload all datasets except for PROTEINS.But the pre-trained model for each datasets is uploaded. You need to change the corresponding parameters in *preprompt.py*,*downprompt.py.py* and *execute.py* to train and evaluate on other datasets.

Command example：
`python execute.py`
